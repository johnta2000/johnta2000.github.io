								<h3> Fall 2019: MATH-241 (Ching-Li Chai)</h3>
								<h4> TA Quality: 3.8/4.0 (Highest ever rated MATH-241 TA via PennCourseReview) </h4>
							</header>

							<p> "John did a fabulous job helping me understand the material presented in this course. Our lectures were often heavy in theory, and John helped my
understanding by both explaining some of the theory and providing good concrete examples."
<br> <br>
"John was an awesome TA and was extremely helpful with communicating information. He was extremely accessible outside of recitation and I would not still
be in Math 241 without his help."
<br> <br>
"[John] went above and beyond in teaching us the material, providing notes and exam study materials, and
being available for office hours. He is solely responsible for anything I learned / the fact that I (hopefully) did well in MATH 241. If there's a TA award, I'd like
to recommend he get it."
<br> <br>
"[John] had many office hours and reviews and could be contacted on piazza, which
was effort on an extraordinary level. He effectively save this course for me"
<br> <br>
"[John] was amazing. He was always accessible and communicated clearly. I would say I learned most of the course from him."
<br> <br>
"John was absolutely amazing! I can confidently say that I learned and understood material from this course only because of his guidance and teaching. His
recitations broke down lecture material in a clear and concise way which helped me work through weekly homework assignments. Though his quizzes were
challenging, they were great learning experiences and helped me understand subtleties and different types of problems we should know how to approach.
Prior to exams, he was always accessible through additional office hours and extremely timely responses via Piazza or email. His website was also such an
amazing resource with past exams, his own solutions to homework sets/exams, etc. I have nothing but praise for John and am highly impressed by his
dedication to students!"
<br> <br>
"The most responsible and kind TA I have ever seen in the math department. Great job!"
